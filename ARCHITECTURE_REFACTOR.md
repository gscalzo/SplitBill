# Architecture Refactor - Split Bill App

## Overview

The Split Bill app has been refactored from a monolithic MainActivity containing all business logic
to a clean, testable MVVM architecture following Android best practices. The app now includes
comprehensive **bill splitting functionality** that allows users to assign receipt items to
participants and calculate individual balances.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Problems)
- All business logic in MainActivity (800+ lines)
- Receipt calculations mixed with UI code
- Impossible to unit test business logic
- State management scattered throughout UI components
- Violation of single responsibility principle
- No bill splitting capabilities

### After (Solution)
Clean separation of concerns following MVVM + Clean Architecture principles:

```
UI Layer (Composables)
    ‚Üì
ViewModel Layer (State Management)
    ‚Üì
Domain Layer (Business Logic + Bill Splitting)
    ‚Üì
Service Layer (External Dependencies)
```

## New Structure

### 1. Domain Models (`data/ReceiptModels.kt`)
- **`ReceiptCalculation`**: Pure business logic for calculating totals, discrepancies
- **`EditableReceipt`**: Immutable domain model for receipt state management
- **`Participant`**: Represents bill splitting participants with unique IDs
- **`ItemAssignment`**: Sealed class for different assignment types (Individual, Equal Split,
  Unassigned)
- **`AssignedReceiptItem`**: Receipt items with assignment information
- **`ParticipantBalance`**: Individual balance calculations with itemized breakdown
- **`BillSplitSummary`**: Complete splitting summary with assignment status
- **`EditableReceiptWithSplitting`**: Enhanced receipt model with splitting capabilities
- All calculations are pure functions with no side effects

### 2. ViewModel (`ui/ReceiptViewModel.kt`)
- **`ReceiptViewModel`**: Manages UI state using StateFlow
- **`ReceiptUiState`**: Sealed class representing all possible UI states
- Handles user actions and delegates to domain logic
- No Android dependencies (easily testable)
- Handles participant management and item assignments
- Maintains balance calculations in real-time

### 3. UI Components (`ui/ReceiptScreen.kt`)
- **`ReceiptScreen`**: Main receipt display composable
- **`ReceiptScreen.kt`**: Enhanced with "Split Bill" button
- **`SplittingScreen.kt`**: New screen for managing participants and assignments
- **`BalanceSummaryScreen.kt`**: New screen for displaying individual balances
- **Reusable components**: EditableTotal, EditableServiceCharge, EditableReceiptItem, Participant
  management, assignment dialogs, balance cards
- **Screen states**: LoadingScreen, ErrorScreen, WelcomeScreen, SplittingMode, BalanceSummary
- Pure UI with no business logic

### 4. MainActivity (Simplified)
- Only handles navigation, permissions, and image capture
- Delegates all business logic to ViewModel
- Clean separation of UI concerns
- Handles navigation between all screens

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Testability**

- Business logic is now fully unit testable
- Created comprehensive test suites:
    - `ReceiptCalculationTest`: Tests all calculation scenarios

## Business Logic Improvements

### Bill Splitting Engine
```kotlin
sealed class ItemAssignment {
    data class EqualSplit(val participantIds: List<String>) : ItemAssignment()
    data class IndividualAssignment(val participantId: String) : ItemAssignment()
    object Unassigned : ItemAssignment()
}

data class BillSplitSummary(
    val participants: List<Participant>,
    val balances: List<ParticipantBalance>,
    val totalAssigned: Double,
    val totalUnassigned: Double,
    val isFullyAssigned: Boolean
)
```

### Balance Calculation
```kotlin
private fun calculateParticipantBalance(
    participant: Participant,
    assignedItems: List<AssignedReceiptItem>,
    serviceCharge: Double,
    totalParticipants: Int
): ParticipantBalance {
    // Complex calculation logic with split handling
    val participantServiceCharge = serviceCharge / totalParticipants
    // ... detailed implementation
}
```

### Reactive State Management
```kotlin
sealed class ReceiptUiState {
    object Initial : ReceiptUiState()
    object Loading : ReceiptUiState()
    data class Error(val message: String) : ReceiptUiState()
    data class Success(val editableReceipt: EditableReceipt) : ReceiptUiState()
